### Retrospective

- I've noticed that some Frontend Mentor challenges have components that fail WCAG standards for use of color. It's a bit puzzling that the design creators choose color combinations that WCAG considers as having poor contrast ratio. In this challenge, I had to modify the colors of the button and the article numbers to pass WAVE's A11Y evaulation tool.
