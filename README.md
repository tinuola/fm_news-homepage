# Frontend Mentor: News Homepage

Solution to the _[News Homepage](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl/hub)_ challenge on Frontend Mentor.

### Challenge

- Build out a news website homepage using provided [desktop](/assets/design/desktop-design.jpg) and [mobile](/assets/design/mobile-design.jpg) designs
- Users should be able to:
  - View the optimal layout for the UI depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Solution

Live Site: [https://tinuola.github.io/fm_news-homepage/](https://tinuola.github.io/fm_news-homepage/)

### Retrospective

- Project focus was on working with CSS Grid, and first use of the `picture` tag and `srcset` attribute for art direction
- Some Frontend Mentor challenges have design components that fail A11Y evaluation when it comes to color combinations; it's puzzling that the design creators make choices that have poor contrast ratio by WCAG standards.
  - Modified colors of the button and the article numbers to pass [WAVE's evaulation tool](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/).

### Enhancement(s)

- Add animated effect to button and nav links hover states
